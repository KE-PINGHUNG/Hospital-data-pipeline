# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

    # 這是專案中所有模型（包括 staging）的預設設定

    # 這裡可以移除 example 區塊，避免創建不必要的模型

    #   +materialized: view 
    marts:
      # 這裡不要設定 +schema，讓它繼承 profiles.yml 的 'marts' schema
